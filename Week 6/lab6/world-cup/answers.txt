Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations it is more likely to get a wrong answer, but on average all the predictions were similar.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized around 1000
